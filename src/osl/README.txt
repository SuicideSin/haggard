Here's a bunch of small, self-contained utility routines
to evaluate various mathematical functions.  Just read the 
header files to see how they work--everything should be 
copiously commented.

You should be able to pick out one or two header files,
and use them without using anything else here.  You may 
have to follow the #includes to find the few other OSL 
headers these routines rely on.  Linking should also be 
easy--if you use the .h file, build the .cpp file too.

Everything relies on the "osl/" directory name, so just
build your code one level up from this directory and say
#include "osl/vector3d.h"

All these files have built recently on:
	- Windows machines with Visual C++
	- Mac OS X machines with xcode
	- Linux machines with gcc 4
But of course some minor tweaking may be needed.
No major "porting" changes should be necessary.

Of particular scientific computing and mathematical interest:
  vector1d-4d.h: spatial vector class, with +, -, dot, cross, etc.
  random.h/.cpp: pseudorandom number generators for int, float, etc.
      "Random48" or better is recommended for Monte Carlo.
  random_vector.h: 2D and 3D random vectors over cubes and spheres.
  least_squares.h/.cpp: linear least-squares function fitting.
  statistics.h: means, variances, standard deviations in an easy interface.
  matrix.h/.cpp: a dynamically allocated arbitrary-size matrix.
  fn1d.h: 1D function root-finding, with bisection and secant methods.

Of particular computer graphics interest:
  vector3d.h: spatial vector class, with +, -, dot, cross, etc.
  vector_util.cpp: non-inlined routines for vector1d-4d.
  viewpoint.h/.cpp: 3D projective camera class.
  perlin_noise.h/.cpp: smooth 3D noise function (by Ken Perlin).

Of particular portability and networking interest:

  dll.h/.cpp: portable dynamically linked library interface.
  socket.h/.cpp: portable easy-to-use TCP socket wrapper.
  sha1.h/.cpp: Secure Hash Algorithm-1.  FIPS standard crypto hash.
